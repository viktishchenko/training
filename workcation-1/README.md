# Workcation

[Live preview](https://workcation.netlify.com/)

Workcation is the demo project for the upcoming ["Designing with Tailwind CSS" course](https://tailwindcss.com/course/) I'm working on.

It's a fun Airbnb-inspired UI that includes a bunch of neat ideas which make it perfect for teaching people how to build things with Tailwind.

The complete free course will be released early July, but you can watch me build the entire UI from scratch on YouTube in the mean time:
